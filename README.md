## Study Questions (5 points x 3 = 15 points)

### Q1. (5 points)

The values in the "count" column simply wouldn't load/register. Every instance of "d.value" would need to be changed to d.count.

### Q2. (5 points)

There are many reasons to use D3 over something like Excel. First of all, D3 can handle much larger volumes of data and can update its visualizations in real-time based on data from external sources. Because D3 is JavaScript rather than proprietary local software, charts can be hosted over a server, displayed in a web page, and can be customized in any way that html/css/JavaScript allow.

### Q3. (5 points)

Data in TSV and CSV files are recognized as strings by default. The type argument specifies the data type that the data in a column should be recognized as.
