## Study Questions (5 points x 3 = 15 points)

### Q1. (5 points)

We wouldn't be able to return the values in the TSV file because there is no member named "value" anymore. The code is accessed by calling d.value, and that would need to be changed to "d.count" at every spot
in the code.

### Q2. (5 points)

D3 allows us to modify/add to several elements at the same time, which allows us to avoid restructuring our entire code everytime we want to make a change. We can also chain methods with D3 in order to easier 
perform several actions on one selection with clean code. D3 also makes it easy to work with dynamically changing data by using functions and scaling.

### Q3. (5 points)

"type" is a function call which parses and converts types in order to allow for better data handling. D3 is incapable of doing this on its own, so we need this function call.
