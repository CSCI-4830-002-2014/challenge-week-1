## Study Questions (5 points x 3 = 15 points)

### Q1. (5 points)

If I changed the two headings, I wouldn't need to change any codt for name =>
firstname, as it is never called in the code, but I rely on d.value quite a few 
times (4?) and I would need to change the function call to d.count

### Q2. (5 points)

The benifeits of D3 are summed up nicely in the "give/teach a man to fish..." parable.
The largest benifit of D3 is the dynamic nature of it, as well as the seamless integration
into javascript/webpages. The ability to dynamically generate visulizations of data on the web are huge and in large demand at the moment, if I used excel I would need to make a new 
chart -every- time my data changed, not dynamic at all, and then figure out how to get it in a static webpage. D3 is flexible, responsive, and capable of handeling big data. 

### Q3. (5 points)

"type" is really a function call to a defined function named type. the purpose is to coerce
the d.value variable into a number as opposed to a string, as tsv.parse isn't smart enough
to figure the typing out for us.
