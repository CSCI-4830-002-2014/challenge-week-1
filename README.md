## Study Questions (5 points x 3 = 15 points)

### Q1. (5 points)

Each data point is now an object rather than a number and the data heading represents the key for each key:value pair in the object. As a result, changing the heading in the data will break the javascript code since the data is no longer mapped to the key it was expecting. Changing the heading 'value' to 'count' would require that you change all places in the code referencing 'd.value' to 'd.count'.

### Q2. (5 points)

One of the primary benefits of using D3 over other tools is that it allows for visualizations to be dynamic, where tools such as Excel create static graphs. This is powerful because, once a visualization for a dataset is created (assuming the data is hosted online), new data can be added to the dataset at a later date and the visualization will automatically reflect the change.

### Q3. (5 points)

The second argument of d3.tsv is a property accessor. In this example, we define a method type() to coerce the data type from the file we're reading to be a number since it's passed in as a string.
